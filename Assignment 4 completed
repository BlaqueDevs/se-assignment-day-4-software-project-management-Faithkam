3)	Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

There are various development methodologies that guide the software development process, each depending upon the requirements of the projects, the level of involvement of the user/client and the degree of uncertainty in the process. A comparison of the two methods will be based on approach to development, requirements management, planning of the project and execution, testing, customer involvement, flexibility and adaptability. Its advantages will be fully incorporated into the comparisons.
Approach to development
The waterfall methodology is based on a sequential approach, whereby each phase must be completed prior to starting a new one. It is predictive in that it requires all the requirements to be gathered prior to the commencement of the project, and that changes are costly and disruptive. This approach is best suited for projects with clearly defined requirements and minimal changes are expected. The agile methodology follows an iterative approach, whereby development inform of iterations is done producing a working piece of software, requirements are altered based on feedback from previous iterations. Required changes can be incorporated regardless of the stage in the development process, enabling flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of the user. The agile approach is ideal for projects with ever-changing requirements, which needs regular adjustments. It is based on delivering small, incremental improvements.
Requirements management
The waterfall methodology requires extensive documentation at the beginning of the project, assumes that changes to requirements can lead to extensive costs and delays. The Agile approach requires less documentation and is sorely based on teamwork fostering close relationships with stakeholders to adapt to new information and feedback.
Project planning and execution
In terms of project planning, the waterfall requires a detailed project plan prior to development, which outlines the scope, timelines and resources. The methodology has longer development cycles compared to the Agile approach, whereby testing is executed only after the development phase is completed. The Agile methodology involves continuous planning, with regular review checks and adjustment planning. Due to shorter timelines, working software are released quickly.
Testing 
Testing is done once the development phase is completed in the Waterfall methodology, whereas the agile approach allows for continuous testing throughout the process. The Agile approach incorporates testing in every iteration to ensure that features added work correctly and do not introduce new issues whereas the waterfall approach is based on the ideology that new issues detected on the testing phase can be costly and may result in resorting back to earlier phases.
Flexibility and adaptability
The waterfall approach is less flexible, changes to requirements are difficult to implement once the project is underway. This approach is less suitable to dynamic and complex projects, where requirements are not clear from the beginning. The agile methodology is highly flexible, incorporating changes and adapting to ever-changing requirements. It is ideal for projects with dynamic requirements.
Although the Agile approach has its advantages, its disadvantages may stem from frequent changes and ever-changing requirements which can result in scope creeps, thereby affecting timelines. Resource intensity, particularly time. The approach requires continuous collaboration and constant communication through regular meetings with stakeholders and clients, which can be demanding on team members. Moreover, managing large teams or complex projects can be very challenging, which may result in coordination problems. In addition, there is a risk of overlooking strategic goals by merely focusing on incremental improvements.
Waterfall methodology has its disadvantages which includes, its inflexibility to change, late testing, risk of misalignment with client needs, difficulties in managing uncertainties. The waterfall methodology is based on the notion that once a phase is completed, making changes or adjustments can be costly, which is problematic when handling projects that change requirements overtime. Late testing can result in identifying significant issues or defects late in the project, which is time consuming and costly to fix. The approach is prone to risk of misalignment with client needs, since customer involvement is restricted to the requirements phase and the final delivery phase.
4)	In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Choosing between Agile and Waterfall methodologies varies with the nature of projects, its requirements and environment in which it operates. Agile is more beneficial for projects characterized by ever-changing requirements, high complexities and uncertainties, frequent customer and stakeholder engagement, innovation and rapid development, dynamic and fast-paced environments, cross-functional teams for easier collaboration.
